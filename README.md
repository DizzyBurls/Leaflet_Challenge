# Description:

In this project I have written scripts which, to my knowledge, satisfy every section of the task including that belonging to the BONUS section. 
See screen captures 1 - 6 which I have uploaded to this repository. They show main features that we were required to create.

    I would like to thank Brandon Wong from the BSC 24/7 help team for assisting me. I was finding it difficult to import the tectonc plates data and he was able to spot a really tiny error in my code. Bravo!!
